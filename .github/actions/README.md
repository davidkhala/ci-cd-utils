# Reusable workflows repository
According to https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows
- This is for storing reusable workflows. Not workflows of this ci-cd-utils project

## Notes
- reusable workflows should be referenced at the top-level `jobs.*.uses' key, not within steps
