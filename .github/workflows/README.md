# Github Workflow

![](https://github.com/davidkhala/ci-cd-utils/workflows/githubWorkflow.yml/badge.svg)
## Badge URL syntax
If your workflow uses the name keyword, you must reference the workflow by name. 

> https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/workflows/<WORKFLOW_NAME>/badge.svg

Else if your workflow doesn't have a name, you must reference the workflow file using the file path relative to the repository's root directory.

> https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILE_PATH>/badge.svg

Using the branch parameter, Add `?branch=<branchName>` to the end of SVG URL
